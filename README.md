# Zencastr cache interview

An interview for Zencastr

## Installing / Getting started

This repo contains a NodeJS application.
Everything is self contained in development environment.

### Built With

NodeJS, Express, Jest

### Prerequisites

A docker environment or Node JS is needed to run this project. Packages can
be installed through npm.

### Development

I decided on pure Javascript instead of Typescript due to the scope. To properly
setup a Typescript project seemed like overkill for the requirement specification.

This is ultimately the bare bones of a real cache library. Many more tests and features
would realistically be required to be considered production-ready.

## Tests

Jest is our testing framework of choice.

To run the test...
```shell
npm test
```
